# FFMpeg Video Editing Tool

McSwiss is a video editing tool that wraps FFMpeg in a modern GUI to make bulk editing tasks easy. McSwiss is an Electron app built with Vue 3, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.

NOTE: McSwiss is still in development. Currently the only tool that works (without error handling) is the Preview Generator.
